# Katacoda Scenarios

This repo contains a collection of [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/) scenarios. 
[Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/) is a platform that allows developers to create virtual labs, aka scenarios.
Each scenario is meant to teach a topic through explanation and practical exercices.

Currently available scenarios:
- the [PromQL](promql/README.md) scenario is meant to teach how to use Grafana and PromQL to 
create dashboards


## How to add scenarios

A scenario is created in a folder a the top level of the repository.
At the bare minimum the scenario has to contain an `index.json` as described in 
[this page](https://www.katacoda.community/scenario-syntax.html#understanding-katacoda-s-index-json).

The full documentation on how to configure scenarios can be found 
[here](https://www.katacoda.community/welcome.html).

Once a scenario is created, it will appear in [this profile page](https://www.katacoda.com/berny).
